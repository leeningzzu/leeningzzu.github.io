> 读书须知出入法。始当求所以入，终当求所以出。见得亲切，此是入书法；用得透脱，此是出书法。盖不能入得书，则不知古人用心处；不能出得书，则又死在言下。唯知出知入，得尽读书之法也.

## How to read in proper way
I have been reading The Economist since Nov 2018, but I did not feel I made some progress in writing and listening, there must be something wrong,there should be the right way to open it.  

**What should I grasp**

  * the editorial stance  
 > only when we get the real standpoint, can realize the value of the article
  * the background information  
  > the source of knowledge (Wiki,Google,literature) is the foundation   
  * the vocabulary  
  1. transitional words
  2. the meaning in different situations
  3. the synonyms

Only persistence makes progress. Yeah, I believe I can execute the plan, just do it.
