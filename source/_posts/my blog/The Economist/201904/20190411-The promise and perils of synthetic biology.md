# <center>The promise and perils of synthetic biology<center>
## paragraph 1
> *Introduce the conventional point: gene mutation and natural selection*  
>1. the theory  
>2. what happened with copying mistakenly  
>3. the result of mistake  
>4.  the fundamental theory  

For the past four billion years or so **the only way for life on Earth to** produce a sequence of dna—a gene—**was by** copying a sequence it already had to hand<sup>1</sup>. Sometimes the gene would be damaged or <font color=red>scrambled</font>, the copying imperfect or undertaken repeatedly<sup>2</sup>. From that raw material arose <font color=red>the glories of</font> natural selection<sup>3</sup>. But beneath it all, gene begat gene<sup>4</sup>.
> damaged vs imperfect, scramble vs repeatd  
> <font color=red>scrambled</font>: [VERB 动词] (迅速地)爬,攀登；If you scramble over rocks or up a hill, you move quickly over them or up it using your hands to help you. [V prep/adv]  
> <font color=red>the glories of</font>: The glories of a culture or place are the things that people admire most about it. [usu pl]  

## paragraph 2
> *Genes can be engineered artificially, not only by natural selection*
> 1. compare with the traditional situation
> 2. man-made genes can be done
> 3. a fundamental change with the ability
> 4. example: diffierent types of things were built by molecule
> 5. cells can be engineerable
> 6. examples

That is no longer true<sup>1</sup>. Now genes can be written <font color=red>from scratch</font> and edited repeatedly, like text in a word processor<sup>2</sup>. **The ability** to engineer living things which this provides **represents** a fundamental change in the way humans interact with the planet’s life<sup>3</sup>. It permits the manufacture of <font color=red>all manner of</font> things which used to be hard, even impossible, to make: pharmaceuticals, fuels, fabrics, foods and fragrances can all be built molecule by molecule<sup>4</sup>. What cells do and what they can become is engineerable, too<sup>5</sup>. Immune cells can be told to follow doctors’ orders; stem cells better <font color=red>coaxed</font> to turn into new tissues; fertilised eggs programmed to grow into creatures quite unlike their parents<sup>6</sup>.
><font color=red>from scratch</font>:[PHRASE 短语] 从零开始;从头做起;白手起家；If you do something from scratch, you do it without making use of anything that has been done before. [PHR after v]  
<font color=red>all manner of</font>: idom, a lot of different types  
<font color=red>coax</font>: [VERB 动词] 连哄带劝地得到；If you coax something such as information out of someone, you gently persuade them to give it to you. [V n out of/from n]
## paragrah 3
> *the envision of synthetic biology*  
> 1. the consequences of synthetic biology
> 2. the envision of biological manufacturing
> 3. example  

The earliest stages of such “synthetic biology” are already changing many industrial processes, transforming medicine and beginning to reach into the consumer world (see Technology Quarterly)<sup>1</sup>. Progress may be slow, but **with the help of** new tools **and** <font color=red>a big dollop of</font>  machine learning, biological manufacturing **could eventually yield truly** <font color=red>cornucopian</font> technologies<sup>2</sup>. Buildings may be grown from synthetic wood or coral<sup>3</sup>. Mammoths produced from engineered elephant cells may yet stride across Siberia<sup>4</sup>.
><font color=red>a big dollop of</font>: 少量，一点，些许 an amount of something  
<font color=red>cornucopian</font>: adj. 丰富的,丰饶的
## paragraph 4
> *we should harness the promise and minimise the peril of synthetic biology*
> 1. introduce the dark side of synthetic biology
> 2.look back through human history
> 3. side-effects with transformation
> 4. introuduce the drawback of synthetic biology
> 5. conclude the point

The scale of the potential changes seems hard to imagine<sup>1</sup>. But <font color=red>look back through</font> history, and humanity’s relations with the living world **have seen** three great transformations: the exploitation of fossil fuels, the globalisation of the world’s ecosystems after the European conquest of the Americas, and the <font color=red>domestication</font> of crops and animals at the dawn of agriculture<sup>2</sup>. **All brought prosperity and progress, but with damaging side-effects**<sup>3</sup>. Synthetic biology promises similar transformation<sup>4</sup>. **To harness the promise and minimise the peril, it pays to learn the lessons of the past**<sup>5</sup>.
> <font color=red>domestication</font>: n. 驯养；教化
## paragraph 5
> *benefits of synthetic biology on environmental goals in the exploitation of fossil fuels*
> 1. example
> 2. the value of fossil fuels on economy
> 3. the side-effects of fossil fuels on wilderness and climate
> 4. transition: the advantage of synthetic biology
> 5. replace some fuels
> 6. example: plant protein
> 7. the benefit explained furtherly
> 8. example  

**The new biology calls all in doubt**  
Start with the most recent of these previous shifts<sup>1</sup>. Fossil fuels have enabled humans to <font color=red>drive remarkable economic expansion</font> in the present using biological productivity from ages past, stored away in coal and oil<sup>2</sup>. But much wilderness has been lost, and carbon atoms which last saw the atmosphere hundreds of millions of years ago **have strengthened the planet’s greenhouse effect** to a degree that may prove catastrophic<sup>3</sup>. Here, synthetic biology can do good<sup>4</sup>. It is already being used to replace some products made from petrochemicals; in time it could replace some fuels, too<sup>5</sup>. This week Burger King introduced into some of its restaurants a beefless Whopper that gets its meatiness from an engineered plant protein; such innovations could greatly ease a shift to less environmentally taxing diets<sup>6</sup>. They could also be used to do <font color=red>more with less</font><sup>7</sup>. Plants and their soil microbes could produce their own fertilisers and pesticides, ruminants less greenhouse gas—though to ensure that synthetic biology yields such <font color=red>laudable</font> environmental goals will take public policy as well as the cues of the market<sup>8</sup>.
> <font color=red>more with less</font>: 以更小的资源完成更重的活  
> <font color=red>laudable</font>: [ADJ-GRADED 能被表示程度的副词或介词词组修饰的形容词] 可嘉的；值得赞美的；值得称许的；Something that is laudable deserves to be praised or admired. [Formal]
## paragraph 6
> *the usage and the ideal of synthetic biology*
> 1. the usage of synthetic biology
> 2. transition
> 3. the fundamentation of synthetic biology application  
> 4. Realistic conditions 
> 5. compare with the weapons using by armies.  
> 6. the ideal of synthetic biology
> 7. conclusion the view  

Synthetic biology could create such weapons by design: pathogens designed **to weaken, to incapacitate or to kill, and perhaps also to limit** themselves to particular types of target<sup>1</sup>. There is real cause for concern here—but not for immediate alarm<sup>2</sup>. For such weaponisation would, like the rest of  <font color=red>cutting-edge</font> synthetic biology, take highly skilled teams with significant resources<sup>3</sup>. And armies already have lots of ways to flatten cities and kill people in large numbers<sup>4</sup>. **When it comes to** mass destruction, a disease is a poor substitute for a nuke<sup>5</sup>. **What’s more**, today’s synthetic-biology community lives up to ideals of openness and public service better than many older fields<sup>6</sup>. **Maintained and nurtured**, that culture should serve as a powerful immune system against rogue elements<sup>7</sup>.

> <font color=red>cutting-edge</font>: ① **[ADJ 形容词]** 最前沿的;最先进的;尖端的；Cutting-edge techniques or equipment are the most advanced that there are in a particular field. [usu ADJ n]   
>②[N-SING **单数名词**] (某事物发展的)尖端，最前沿，领先阶段；If you are at the cutting edge of a particular field of activity, you are involved in its most important or most exciting developments. [usu at/on the N of n]  
③ [N-SING **单数名词**] 有利方面;优势；If someone or something gives you a cutting edge, they give you an advantage over your competitors.  
## paragraph 7
> *the effect of domestication on human life*  
> 1. the importance of biological transformation
> 2. instances
> 3. the results of domestication
> 4. the effect on human selves.


The earliest biological transformation—domestication—produced what was hitherto the biggest change in how humans lived their lives<sup>1</sup>. <font color=red>Haphazardly</font>, then purposefully, humans **bred cereals to be more bountiful, livestock to be more docile, dogs more obedient and cats more companionable** (the last a partial success, at best)<sup>2</sup>. This allowed new densities of settlement and new forms of social organisation: the market, the city, the state<sup>3</sup>. Humans domesticated themselves as well as their crops and animals, creating space for the <font color=red>drudgery</font> of subsistence agriculture and <font color=red>oppressive</font> political hierarchies<sup>4</sup>.  
> <font color=red>drudgery</font>: [N-UNCOUNT 不可数名词] 单调乏味的苦差事;无聊的工作；You use drudgery to refer to jobs and tasks which are boring or unpleasant but which must be done  
> <font color=red>oppressive</font>: ① [ADJ-GRADED 能被表示程度的副词或介词词组修饰的形容词] 社会、法律、习俗等压迫的，压制的，暴虐的，不公的；If you describe a society, its laws, or customs as oppressive, you think they treat people cruelly and unfairly.  
> ② [ADJ-GRADED 能被表示程度的副词或介词词组修饰的形容词] 社会、法律、习俗等压迫的，压制的，暴虐的，不公的；If you describe a society, its laws, or customs as oppressive, you think they treat people cruelly and unfairly.  
> ③ [ADJ-GRADED 能被表示程度的副词或介词词组修饰的形容词] 令人心情沉重的；让人感到压抑的；使人苦恼的；An oppressive situation makes you feel depressed and uncomfortable. [usu ADJ n]  
## paragraph 8
> *the effect of synthetic biology comparing with domestication*  
> 1. correspond to the paragraph 7, describe the effect of synthetic biology
> 2. example
> 3. imaging what may happen in the future
> 4. the choose

Synthetic biology will have a similar <font color=red>cascading effect</font>, transforming humans’ relationships with each other and, potentially, their own biological nature<sup>1</sup>. The ability to reprogram the embryo is, <font color=red>rightly</font>, the site of most of today’s ethical concerns<sup>2</sup>. In future, they may extend further; what should one make of people with the upper-body strength of gorillas, or minds <font color=red>impervious</font> to sorrow<sup>3</sup>? How humans may choose to change themselves biologically is hard to say; that some choices will be controversial is not<sup>4</sup>.
> <font color=red>cascading effect</font>: 级联效应  
> <font color=red>rightly</font>: correctly, or for a good reason正确地; 有道理地，有充分理由  
> <font color=red>impervious</font>: ①[ADJ-GRADED 能被表示程度的副词或介词词组修饰的形容词] 无动于衷的;不受影响的；If you are impervious to someone's actions, you are not affected or influenced by them. [usu v-link ADJ]  
> ②[ADJ 形容词] 防渗漏的;不能渗透的;不能穿过的；Something that is impervious to water, heat, or a particular object is able to resist it or stop it passing through it. [oft ADJ to n]
## paragraph 9
> *conclude the unanticipated effects of synthetic biology*
> 1. introduce the cause of difference between the four transformation
> 2. retrosect
> 3. foresight
> 4. unanticipated effects
> 5. the driving force 
> 6. the certain change
> 7. it is a double-edged sword  

Which leads to the main way in which this transformation differs from the three that came before<sup>1</sup>. Their significance was discovered only in **retrospect**<sup>2</sup>. This time, there will be **foresight**<sup>3</sup>. It will not be perfect: there will certainly be **unanticipated effects**<sup>4</sup>. But synthetic biology will **be driven by** the pursuit of goals, both anticipated and desired<sup>5</sup>. It will challenge the human capacity for wisdom and foresight<sup>6</sup>. It might defeat it. But carefully nurtured, it might also help expand it<sup>7</sup>.
